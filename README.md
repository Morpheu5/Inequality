# Inequality

Multi-modal equation entry on the web.

Inequality is the drag-and-drop, symbolic entry system developed for https://isaacphysics.org for users to enter symbolic maths (and chemistry, and boolean logic) in a way familiar to a high school student who does not know any other specialist syntax.

This package is currently a little hard to integrate but worry not for instructions will eventually appear.

Somewhere.

Maybe.
